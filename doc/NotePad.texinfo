Note Pad  was designed to be simple and intuitive, so you should be able to
get started writing notes without using this manual.

@node Device Compatibility, Permissions, The Basics, The Basics
@section Device Compatibility

The application is designed for compatibility with Android 12 (Snow
Cone) but also runs on Android 2.2 (Froyo) through 14 (Upside-down
Cake) which should cover 98.6% of Android devices on the market as of
February 2025.  (It has been tested on Gingerbread, Ice Cream
Sandwich, Lollipop, Marshmallow, Oreo, Quince Tart, Tiramisu, and
Upside-down Cake.)  Support for newer Android devices is planned.

@node Permissions, Adding Notes, Device Compatibility, The Basics
@section Permissions

When installing the NotePad app or when using certain features,
Android may ask you to grant permission for the app to access some
system-level functions.  The permission the app requests is:

@itemize @bullet
@item Write files to external storage (Marshmallow or earlier).
The app uses this on older Android devices when you export your
NotePad data to a file for backup or transfer.  In Android 6
(Marshmallow), this is only needed if you select a backup file
location outside of the app's private folder.  In Android 7 (Nougat)
and later, this permission is not required since the app uses
Android's Storage Access Framework.
@end itemize

@node Adding Notes, Editing Notes, Permissions, The Basics
@section Adding Notes

To add a new note, press ``New'', then start typing the note.

When finished writing the note, press ``Done''.  The first line of the
note is shown in the notes list.

@node Editing Notes, Deleting Notes, Adding Notes, The Basics
@section Editing Notes

To make changes to an existing note, tap on the note heading.  After
editing the note, press ``Done''.

If you want to discard your changes to the note, press the Back
button.  The app will ask you to confirm whether you want to discard
the changes.  If you pressed Back by accident, you can press
``Cancel'' to return to editing your note.

@node Deleting Notes, Categorizing Notes, Editing Notes, The Basics
@section Deleting Notes

If you no longer need a note, there are two ways to delete it.  Tap
the note heading to enter the editor.

The first way is to press @clicksequence{Details @dots @click{} Delete}.

The second is to delete all of the text of the note, then press
@clicksequence{Done}.  The app removes any empty note.

@node Categorizing Notes, Private Notes, The Basics, Top
@chapter Categorizing Notes

Each note can be assigned to a different category, allowing you to
organize your notes.

When the application is first installed it comes with just one
category, ``Unfiled'', and all new notes will be in this category.  To
add new categories, open the category drop-down list next to the
``New'' button, then select ``Edit categories@dots''.

@image{Default_category_list,72mm,58.4mm}

From the next screen, press ``New'' to make a new line in the category
list, then enter the name of the category right on that page.  Repeat
for every category you want to create.  You can also change previously
entered categories on this page.  When finished, press ``OK'' to save
the new category list, or ``Cancel'' to discard your changes.

@image{Edit_categories,72mm,38.5mm}

Now when you create or edit a note, you will have the option of
changing the category it is assigned to by going to the
``Details@dots'' dialog.

@image{Custom_category_list,72mm,128mm}

On the note list, open the category drop-down and select one of your
custom categories to show only the notes in that category.  New notes
will default to the currently selected category.  If you select
``All'', then notes from all categories will be shown.

@node Private Notes, Exporting and Importing, Categorizing Notes, Top
@chapter Private Notes

Notes can be marked as ``Private'', in which case they are normally
hidden in your list of notes unless you turn on ``Show private
records'' in the application settings.  To make a note private, open
the ``Details@dots'' dialog from the note editor and check the
``Private'' box.

@image{Private_note,72mm,128mm}

@image{Show_private_records,72mm,33.1mm}

You can add an extra layer of security to your private notes by
setting a password from the application's main menu.  After setting a
password, all of your private notes will be encrypted and will show up
as ``[Locked]'' in your note list and you will not be able to edit
them until you enter your password in the application settings.  When
you exit the application, it forgets your password so that the private
notes become locked again the next time anybody opens your Note Pad.

@image{Set_password,72mm,59.1mm}

@image{Encrypted_note,72mm,37.9mm}

@b{Important!  If you have not entered your password in the
application settings and you mark a note as Private, it will @i{not}
be encrypted.}  If you want to encrypt a new note but have not entered
your password yet, simply save it, enter your password in the
application settings, open up your new note and save it again.

You can remove your password and un-encrypt your private notes by
choosing ``Set Password'' from the main menu, enter your old password,
but leave the new password blank.

@node Lost Password, Exporting and Importing, Private Notes, Private Notes
@section Lost Password

If you have set a password and later forget what it was, you will not be
able to access your encrypted private notes.  The only way to recover
from this situation and reset your password is to erase the application
data.

@enumerate
@item
If you have any private notes which were @i{not} encrypted (because
they were created without a password,) change them so they are not
private.

@item
Export a backup copy of your Note Pad data, but @i{do not} include private
notes.

@item
Exit the Note Pad application, and open up the Android Settings.

@image{App_drawer,72mm,128mm}

@section Exporting Notes

In order to protect against the loss of data on your Android device,
you should periodically make a backup copy.  First, if you have set a
password for your private notes make sure you have entered the
password in the ``Settings'' to unlock them.  Then in the main menu
select ``Export Data'' to save all of your notes to a file on your
device.

@image{Export-private,72mm,64.6mm}

You can choose where to save the file and what to name it, but by
default it is saved to your the app's private storage area on your
device.  The export dialog shows the location of this storage, which
can vary depending on your version of Android --- for example:
@file{/sdcard/Android/Data/com.xmission.trevin.android.notes/files}.

@page

If you select ``Saved to shared storage'', you have the option to save
it anywhere supported by Android's Storage Access Framework if running
Android 7 (Nougat) or newer.  You will need to enter the name of the
export file you wish to save, ending in @file{.xml}.

@image{SAF-Create_Document,72mm,83.6mm}

After pressing ``Save'' you will return to the app's Export screen.

@page

If you are using Android 6 (Marshmallow) or older, selecting ``Save to
shared storage'' will change the folder to the device's default
@file{Downloads} directory.  You can change the location by typing it
in, but be sure the location is accessible.

@image{Export-shared,72mm,84.7mm}

If you wish to include private notes in the exported file, be sure the
``Include Private'' box is checked.  You can also export just the
non-private notes by leaving this box unchecked.  When ready, press
``Export''.  The app will show a progress bar as it writes the notes
out (if it takes long enough) then return to the list.

@page

@node Importing Notes, Known Bugs, Exporting Notes, Exporting and Importing
@section Importing Notes

When you need to restore notes from your backup file, select ``Import
Data'' from the main menu and select or enter the location of the file
to import.  If you are importing the notes you previously saved to the
app's private storage area, you will need to enter the same name that
you gave the exported file.

@image{Import-private,72mm,95.9mm}

@page

If you are importing notes from a file in shared storage, select
``File from shared storage''.  On Android 7 (Nougat) or newer, you can
browse through the available storage folders to find the @file{.xml}
file with your saved notes.

@image{SAF-Open_Document,72mm,87.6mm}

When you select the document you will return to the app's Import
screen.

@page

If you are using Android 6 (Marshmallow) or older, selecting ``File
from shared storage'' will change the folder to the device's default
@file{Downloads} directory.  You can change the location by typing it
in, but you will need to know in advance where the file is located;
the app doesn't provide a file browser.

@image{Import-shared,72mm,73.8mm}

Next, select the type of import you wish to perform.  The choices are:

@itemize @bullet
@item ``Clean'':
Use this when importing a backup file to a new device, or if you need
to undo all changes which have been made since the file was exported.
This will erase all of your notes and categories before importing
notes fom the file.

@item ``Overwrite'':
This option will restore all notes from your backup file --- even if
the title has changed --- but leave any new notes in the application
alone.

@item ``Update'':
This option will only import notes from the backup file whose
modification time is newer than the corresponding note in the
application database.  Use this if you want to keep your notes on
multiple devices, to synchronize changes between the two.  If you
update a note on both devices and then try to synchronize them with an
update, the earlier changes will be lost in favor of the later ones.

@item ``Merge'':
This option will import notes from the backup file which have the same
category and title as the corresponding note in the application
database, @i{if} it has a newer modification time, similar to an
Update.  However if the note in the backup file has a different
category or title, or it does not exist in the application database, it
will be added.

@item ``Add'':
This option will add all notes from the backup file as new notes,
regardless of duplicates.  This should be used if you created
different sets of notes on separate devices and want to copy the notes
from one to the other.

@item ``Test'':
This option simply parses the backup file and reads all of its notes
without importing any.  Use this if you need to verify the integrity
of your backup file, particularly if you have manually edited it or
had it created by a different application.

@end itemize

If you had set a password for your private notes when they were
exported, you @emph{will} need that password when you need to import
those encrypted notes back in to the application.  This may be different
than your current password.  @b{Important!  Do not forget the password
you had when you made the backup file.}  Without thet password, it
will be practically impossible to recover your private notes; however
you may still restore all of your non-private notes by un-checking
``Include Private'' on the Import form.

If you have not entered your password in the application settings when
you attempt to import a backup file, the import form will warn you
that any private notes imported will not be encrypted.  You may either
cancel the operation to enter your password in the settings and then
try again, or go ahead and import the data and then re-encrypt the
private notes later.  To encrypt them afterward, either open up and
save each private note individually, or choose ``Set Password'' from
the main menu and change the password.  @emph{(You can change it to the
same password if you wish.)}

@node Known Bugs, , Exporting and Importing, Top
@chapter Known Bugs

The following bugs are known to exist in version 1.4.0 (build date
2025.03.27) of Note Pad.  If you encounter any other bugs, please go
to my project page on GitHub to report them:

@uref{https://github.com/Typraeurion/Android-NotePad/issues}

@itemize @bullet
@item
It is not possible to delete the last remaining category in the category
list.

@item
The amount of notes that can be imported from a previously exported
file is limited by the amount of memory available to the application.
If you find that the application dies when importing a file, try
splitting the file into two or more smaller files, copying the
@samp{<Metadata>} and @samp{<Categories>} sections into each file, and
import them separately.

@item
When importing a backup file, the progress bar may not update properly.
@end itemize

The following bugs were in the 1.3.0 release (built 2015.05.10) but
have been fixed as of 1.3.1 (built 2025.03.16).

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you press the back button while editing a note, all changes are
discarded without warning.
