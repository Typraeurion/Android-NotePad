The Narn and Drazi fleet emerged from hyperspace and devastated Centauri Prime. Mollari rescued G'Kar from the cells, then found the Regent and confronted him.  At this point, Shiv'kala the Drakh agent revealed himself to Mollari.  In order to conceal the involvement of the Drakh, Shiv'kala killed Virini and informed Mollari that he would take his place as the new Emperor of the Centauri Republic, then he would surrender to the Alliance forces and blame the whole conflict on the late regent.  Mollari was forced to accept a Drakh Keeper and agree to their demands in order to prevent the Drakh from destroying the Centauri home world by detonating the fusion bombs they had planted across the surface.  His first official act as Emperor (as planned by the Drakh) was to sever all ties between the Centauri Republic and the Alliance, after agreeing under protest to make war reparations which would further weaken the economy.  He then arranged for Cotto to go back to Babylon 5 to serve as Ambassador to get him safely out of the Drakh's reach, and made a sad private farewell to Sheridan, Delenn, and G'Kar, who finally forgave Mollari for all the wrongs done to him and his people.
