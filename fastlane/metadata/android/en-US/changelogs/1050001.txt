Version 1.5.0
* Fixed a minor UI issue where the soft keyboard was covering up the
  bottom of a note and the Done and Details buttons in the editor.
* Refactored the app to use an internal repository class instead of having
  a Provider.  This enables more granular automated testing on emulators.
* Added instrumented (automated) tests for the PasswordChangeService,
  XMLExporterService, and XMLImporterService and regular unit
  test cases for StringEncryption to help verify the refactored
  code is functionally identical to the previous code.
* Increased the minimum SDK version from 8 (Froyo) to 14 (Ice
  Cream Sandwich).  Removed old code that was supporting
  backwards compatibility with Honeycomb and older devices.
* Bumped the target SDK version from 32 (Snow Cone) to 33 (Tiramisu).
